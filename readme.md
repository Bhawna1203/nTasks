## ðŸ’¡ Inspiration
As we all know, about 75% of people in the world use Mobile phones and about 45% of users are students and non-earning people using mobile people. So due to different social media apps like Instagram, WhatsApp, Facebook, etc. We lost our focus on our goals and start using this app. So nTASKS App provides us the feature to stay motivated as well as stay away from distractions.

## âš™ What does it do?
It helps the users to stay away from distractions and also motivates them as well.

## ðŸ›  How we built it
For building Frontend, I use XML 
Used SharedPreferences in android for storing data.
Used different dependences like de.hdodenhof:circleimageview:3.1.0

## ðŸ’ª Challenges we ran into
It is my first time building an app using a storage feature. 
We had a difficult time implementing the text overlay on the image as well, and it was hard to make a fully responsive UI.

## ðŸ“Œ Accomplishments that we're proud of
Well, we built a whole app in 11 hours!! That's the biggest achievement of this hackathon.
Able to build the app that really solves the issue.
Ourself for trying our best.
## ðŸ“š What we learned
Learned more about Kotlin. Learned a lot more about Kotlin, Android, and responsive designs.
